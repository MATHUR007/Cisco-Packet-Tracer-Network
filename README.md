My objective was to design and implement network configuration for LAN’s in both London and Manchester offices. This includes creating IP addressing scheme, configuring routers and PC’s, ensuring full connectivity between devices and incorporating wireless network
I have implemented a network infrastructure comprising two LAN networks interconnected by a WAN link between London and Manchester. The London area network comprises a total of eight PCs, three switches, one Access Point and one Router, with a associated cost of 13,500. In the Manchester area, there are four PCs, three switches and one Router, with a network cost amounting to 9,485. The combined cost of the entire network deployment is 22,985. The interconnection between the London and Manchester Routers is established through a Serial DTE wire, while the remaining connections utilize Copper Straight-Through wiring. This setup ensures efficient communication and collaboration between the two locations, meeting the organization's connectivity requirements effectively
